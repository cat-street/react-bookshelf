              "description": "TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript with the potential to solve many of the headaches for which JavaScript is famous. But TypeScript has a learning curve of its own, and understanding how to use it effectively can take time. This book guides you through 62 specific ways to improve your use of TypeScript. Author Dan Vanderkam, a principal software engineer at Sidewalk Labs, shows you how to apply these ideas, following the format popularized by Effective C++ and Effective Java (both from Addison-Wesley). You’ll advance from a beginning or intermediate user familiar with the basics to an advanced user who knows how to use the language well. Effective TypeScript is divided into eight chapters: Getting to Know TypeScript TypeScript’s Type System Type Inference Type Design Working with any Types Declarations and @types Writing and Running Your Code Migrating to TypeScript",

That’s why Facebook, Google, and Microsoft invented gradual static type layers for their dynamically typed JavaScript and Python code. This practical book shows you how one such type layer, TypeScript, is unique among them: it makes programming fun with its powerful static type system. If you’re a programmer with intermediate JavaScript experience, author Boris Cherny will teach you how to master the TypeScript language. You’ll understand how TypeScript can help you eliminate bugs in your code and enable you to scale your code across more engineers than you could before. In this book, you’ll: Start with the basics: Learn about TypeScript’s different types and type operators, including what they’re for and how they’re used Explore advanced topics: Understand TypeScript’s sophisticated type system, including how to safely handle errors and build asynchronous programs Dive in hands-on: Use TypeScript with your favorite frontend and backend frameworks, migrate your existing JavaScript project to TypeScript, and run your TypeScript application in production",

No prior knowledge of TypeScript is required, but a basic understanding of jQuery is expected. This Learning Path is also for experienced TypeScript developers who want to take their skills to the next level, and also for web developers who wish to make the most of TypeScript. What You Will Learn Understand the key TypeScript language features and runtime Install and configure the necessary tools in order to start developing an application Create object-oriented code that adheres to the SOLID principles Develop robust applications with testing (Mocha, Chai, and SinonJS) Apply GoF patterns in an application with a testing approach Identify the challenges when developing an application Migrate JavaScript codebases to TypeScript to improve your workflow Utilize System.JS and Webpack to load scripts and their dependencies Develop high performance server-side applications to run within Node.js In Detail TypeScript is an open source and cross-platform typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript that runs in any browser or any host. TypeScript adds optional static types, classes, and modules to JavaScript, to enable great tooling and better structuring of large JavaScript applications. Through this three-module learning path, you'll learn the ins-and-outs of TypeScript for building more robust software. The first module gets you started with TypeScript and helps you understand the basics of TypeScript and automation tools. Get a detailed description of function, generics, callbacks, and promises, and discover the object-oriented features and memory management functionality of TypeScript. The next module starts by explaining the current challenges when designing and developing an application and how you can solve these challenges by applying the correct design pattern and best practices. You will be introduced to low-level programming concepts to help you write TypeScript code, as well as working with software architecture, best practices, and design aspects. The final module will help you build a complete single page app with Angular 2, create a neat mobile app using NativeScript, and even build a Pac Man game with TypeScript. As if the fun wasn't enough, you'll also find out how to migrate your legacy codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript. By the end of this Learning Path, you will be able to take your skills up a notch and develop full-fledged web applications using the latest features of the TypeScript. This Learning Path combines some of the best that Packt has to offer in one complete, curated package. It includes content from the following Packt products: Learning TypeScript by Remo H. Jansen TypeScript Design Patterns by Vilic Vane TypeScript Blueprints by Ivo Gabe de Wolff Style and approach This is a step-by-step, practical guide covering the fundamentals of TypeScript with practical examples. The end-to-end projects included in this book will give you ready-to-implement solutions for your business scenario, showcasing the depth and robustness of TypeScript.",

With this brief, fast-paced introduction to TypeScript, .NET, Web and Windows 8 application developers who are already familiar with JavaScript will easily get up to speed with TypeScript and decide whether or not to start incorporating it into their own development. TypeScript is ‘JavaScript for Application-scale development’; a superset of JavaScript that brings to it an additional object-oriented-like syntax familiar to .NET programmers that compiles down into simple, clean JavaScript that any browser can run today. It’s also tied to the next version of the JavaScript standard, which means that TypeScript will continue to evolve over time to keep in step with that standard and with the capabilities of the engines that will execute JavaScript applications. If you are a .NET developer, Web designer or developer, or a programmer with a keen interest in scalable applications, TypeScript Revealed is a great way to get started with the language, learn how it compiles into JavaScript, and how easy it is to learn from a .NET/Java developer's perspective. Takes you through the language features in Typescript additional to those in JavaScript Describes the tooling and community support for TypeScript development Discusses how TypeScript can be included in ASP.NET, Windows 8, and node.js application development projects.",

You will also learn how it is related to JavaScript. The book also guides you on how to install TypeScript on Windows and on other platforms. Type annotations, which are very good in defining how the program is indented, are discussed, and thus, you will learn how to work with them. Interfaces, which are good and compatible with most objects, are discussed in detail. Understanding the scope of objects such as \"this\" is very difficult. This book examines arrow functions which are a good mechanism to help you understand the scope of this keyword. Expressions are also used widely in TypeScript, and these have been explored in detail. Classes which are very important in object-oriented programming and for creation of large apps are also covered, along with features such as inheritance which are associated with classes; Iterators have also been explored in detail. The \"for...of\" loop is widely used in TypeScript. This is discussed in this book, along with how to implement it. The spread operator, which is used for the purpose of spreading the elements of an array, is also examined. The following topics are discussed in this book: - A Brief Overview of TypeScript - Installing TypeScript - Type Annotations - Interfaces - Arrow Function Expressions - Classes - Destructuring - for...of - Iterators - Template Strings - Spread Operator - Enums - let",

This book is the ideal introduction to TypeScript, covering both the basics and the techniques you need to build your own applications. We start by setting up the environment and learning about the build tools that support TypeScript. Then we look at scoping of a variable, and the difference between a undefined variable and a null variable. You will then see the difference between an object, an Object, an object literal, and an object built with a constructor, crucial concepts in understanding TypeScript. You will learn how to make your code more generic to increase the reusability of your classes, functions, and structures, and to reduce the burden of duplicating code. We look at creating definition files to transform the actual JavaScript code to be compatible with TypeScript. By the end of the book, you will have worked with everything you need to develop stunning applications using TypeScript. What you will learn Set up the environment quickly to get started with TypeScript Configure TypeScript with essential configurations that run along your code Structure the code using Types and Interfaces to create objects Demonstrate how to create object-oriented code with TypeScript Abstract code with generics to make the code more reusable Transform the actual JavaScript code to be compatible with TypeScript Who this book is for This book is for JavaScript developers who want to get started with TypeScript for building applications.

Key Features Learn all about refactoring - why it is important and how to do it Discover easy ways to refactor code with examples Explore techniques that can be applied to most other programming languages Book Description Refactoring improves your code without changing its behavior. With refactoring, the best approach is to apply small targeted changes to a codebase. Instead of doing a huge sweeping change to your code, refactoring is better as a long-term and continuous enterprise. Refactoring TypeScript explains how to spot bugs and remove them from your code. You’ll start by seeing how wordy conditionals, methods, and null checks make code unhealthy and unstable. Whether it is identifying messy nested conditionals or removing unnecessary methods, this book will show various techniques to avoid these pitfalls and write code that is easier to understand, maintain, and test. By the end of the book, you’ll have learned some of the main causes of unhealthy code, tips to identify them and techniques to address them. What you will learn Spot and fix common code smells to create code that is easier to read and understand Discover ways to identify long methods and refactor them Create objects that keep your code flexible, maintainable, and testable Apply the Single Responsibility Principle to develop less-coupled code Discover how to combine different refactoring techniques Learn ways to solve the issues caused by overusing primitives Who this book is for This book is designed for programmers who are looking to explore various refactoring techniques to develop healthy and maintainable code. Some experience in JavaScript and TypeScript can help you easily grasp the concepts explained in this book.",

A basic JavaScript knowledge would be beneficial. What You Will Learn Move from loose types to predictable strict types Write self-documented API methods and data structures Understand custom generic types for complex data structures Implement Contract with Interfaces Enhance Dependency Injection in Angular via class constructors Explore TypeScript advanced types Build Interactive web apps with Angular and TypeScript In Detail TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, is the default language for building Angular applications from Google. TypeScript 2.0 adds optional static types, classes, and modules to JavaScript, to enable great tooling and better structuring of large JavaScript applications. This book will teach you how to leverage the exciting features of TypeScript while working on Angular projects to build scalable, data-intensive web applications. You will begin by setting up and installing TypeScript and then compile it with JavaScript. You will then learn to write simple JavaScript expressions with TypeScript. You will then go through some built in TypeScript types and accessors. Further you will build web components using TypeScript Interfaces and Decorators. You will go through the Angular form module, which will enable you to write predictable typed forms with TypeScript and learn to use typed DOM events. You will also build a single-page application using the Router module. Lastly, you will consume API data with Angular's HTTP Module and handle responses with RxJS observables.

              "description": "Explore what React, Node, TypeScript, Webpack, and Docker have to offer individually, and how they all fit together in modern app development. React is one of the most popular web development tools available today, and Node.js is extremely popular for server-side development. The fact that both utilize JavaScript is a big selling point, but as developers use the language more, they begin to recognize the shortcomings, and that’s where TypeScript comes in and why it’s gaining in popularity quickly. Add Webpack and Docker to the mix, and you’ve got a potent full development stack on which to build applications. You’ll begin by building a solid foundation of knowledge and quickly expand it by constructing two different real-world apps. These aren’t just simple, contrived examples but real apps that you can choose to install on your servers and use for real. By the end, you will have a solid grasp of building apps with React, Node.js, and TypeScript and a good grasp on how Webpack can be used to optimize and organize your code for deployment. You’ll also understand how Docker can be used to run the apps you build in a clear and well-defined way, all of which will be able to springboard you into creating more advanced apps on your own. What You'll Learn Get a project started and logically structure it Construct a user interface with React and Material-UI Use WebSockets for real-time communication between client and server Build a REST API with Node and Express as another approach to client-server communication Package the app with Webpack for optimized delivery Take a completed app and wrap it up with Docker for easy distribution Review a host of other ancillary topics including NPM, Semantic versioning, Babel, NoSQL, and more Who This Book Is For Web developers with basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and CLI tools who are interested in and in all aspects of application development, and using TypeScript instead of straight JavaScript.",

This is where Typescript comes into the picture; it lets you write pure object-oriented code with ease, giving it the upper hand over JavaScript. This book introduces you to basic TypeScript concepts by gradually modifying standard JavaScript code, which makes learning TypeScript easy for C# ASP.NET developers. As you progress through the chapters, you'll cover object programming concepts, such as classes, interfaces, and generics, and understand how they are related to, and similar in, both ES6 and C#. You will also learn how to use bundlers like WebPack to package your code and other resources. The book explains all concepts using practical examples of ASP.NET Core projects, and reusable TypeScript libraries. Finally, you'll explore the features that TypeScript inherits from either ES6 or C#, or both of them, such as Symbols, Iterables, Promises, and Decorators. By the end of the book, you'll be able to apply all TypeScript concepts to understand the Angular framework better, and you'll have become comfortable with the way in which modules, components, and services are defined and used in Angular. You'll also have gained a good understanding of all the features included in the Angular/ASP.NET Core Visual Studio project template. What you will learn Organize, test, and package large TypeScript code base Add TypeScript to projects using TypeScript declaration files Perform DOM manipulation with TypeScript Develop Angular projects with the Visual Studio Angular project template Define and use inheritance, abstract classes, and methods Leverage TypeScript-type compatibility rules Use WebPack to bundle JavaScript and other resources such as CSS to improve performance Build custom directives and attributes, and learn about animations Who this book is for If you’re a C# or .NET developer looking for an easy accessible way of learning TypeScript, this book is for you.",

              "description": "TypeScript for Programmers TypeScript lets you write JavaScript the way you really want to. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or Java. The popular JavaScript framework Angular is written in TypeScript. Mastering TypeScript can help programmers to write object-oriented programs and have them compiled to JavaScript, both on server side and client side. This is a book for programmers of all walks: professional JavaScript engineers, C# people, Java sympathizers, Python lovers, Ruby aficionados, Haskell nerds. Whatever language(s) you write in, so long as you have some experience programming and know the basics of functions, variables, classes, and errors, this book is for you. Some experience with JavaScript, including a basic knowledge of the Document Object Model (DOM) and the network, will help you along the way while we don't dive deep into these concepts, they are a wellspring of excellent examples, and if you're not familiar with them the examples might not make as much sense. Regardless of what programming languages you've used in the past, what unites all of us is our shared experience of tracking down exceptions, tracing through code line by line to figure out what went wrong and how we can fix it. This is the experience that TypeScript helps prevent by examining your code automatically and pointing out the mistakes you may have missed. It's OK if you haven't worked with a statically typed language before. I'll teach you about types and how to use them effectively to make your programs crash less, document your code better, and scale your applications across more users, engineers, and servers. I'll try to avoid big words when I can, and explain ideas in a way that's intuitive, memorable, and practical, using lots of examples along the way to help keep things concrete. That's the thing about TypeScript: unlike a lot of other typed languages, TypeScript is intensely practical. It invents completely new concepts so you can speak more concisely and precisely, letting you write applications in a way that's fun, modern, and safe. What you will learn in this book: - introduction to Typescript - Environment setup - Program structure - Basic syntax - Data types - Variables - operators - Decision making - Loops - Arrays - Much, much, more!",
